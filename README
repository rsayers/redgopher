RedGopher - A super simple gophper client in Ruby
-------------------------------------------------

RedGopher is a client I wrote so dumb terminals can browse gopherspace.

Every other console client I've tried uses curses, while this is great on a
fully functional terminal,  it doesnt work so well on say a Tandy model 100.

Make sure you edit the first line to reflect the location of your ruby 
interpreter.  This has been tested with 1.9.1, but it *should* work with 1.8,
maybe even older

Running it is simple:

$ redgopher.rb

wiill run the program and connect to my site by default

$ redgopher.rb hostname.com/0/file.txt

will go directly to a file,  if you omit the type, it will assume a type of 1
(a directory), and may guess wrong,  you are advised to enter the full url.

Right now it will only display directories and text files,  all others will
prompt you to download.

After displaying something, you will be presented with a prompt, you can type
the following commands:

b - will take you back in your history
quit - will exit the program
r - will take you to the root of whatever server you are viewing

Type the number next to an item in a directory to view it.

any other string will be interpreted as a hostname and redgopher will try to
connect to its root.  You can't specify paths here,  not yet at least.

All info is dumped to the screen raw,  your local terminals scrolling feature
will be needed to see text larger than a screenfull.
